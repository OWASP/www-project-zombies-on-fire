This OWASP project proposes the development of an open-source, AI assisted framework for generating advanced tabletop cybersecurity exercises. These exercises are built to enhance organizational readiness through dynamic, threat-realistic scenarios that align with OWASP's mission to improve the security of software and systems.
The project addresses the lack of accessible, scalable, and high-fidelity tabletop exercises. Traditional tabletops often fall short limited in scope, unrealistic, or resource-intensive to develop. By using AI to assist in the creation and customization of exercises, this project democratizes access to world-class training tools and aligns with OWASP’s broader goals around secure system development and awareness.
